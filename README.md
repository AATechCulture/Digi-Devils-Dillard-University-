## Challenge Statements Addressed 🧐
- How can we ensure that notifications from passengers reach flight attendants in real-time, regardless
of varying flight conditions and connectivity challenges, to facilitate swift response to emergencies?
- How can the app allow passengers to customize the nature of notifications, ensuring they can categorize
their needs (emergency, special dietary requirements, medical assistance, etc.) accurately, enabling flight
attendants to prioritize and respond efficiently?
- What mechanisms can be implemented within the app to collect feedback from passengers about their
communication experience, enabling continuous improvement and refinement of the application's features and usability?

## Project Description 🤓
This app is a dedicated communication platform designed to enhance the interaction between passengers 
and flight attendants during flights. It enables passengers to swiftly notify flight attendants about 
emergencies or specific requirements through instant notifications, ensuring quick response and 
efficient assistance. By bridging the communication gap, the app aims to create a safer and more 
comfortable travel experience for all passengers on board.

## Project Value 🤑
An app that enables passengers to communicate with flight attendants via text would primarily target air travelers seeking a more convenient and efficient way to address their concerns during flights. This feature would benefit passengers by providing a direct and discreet means of communication, allowing them to report issues, request assistance, or ask questions without having to rely on in-person interactions or the overhead call button. For flight attendants, the app would streamline communication, making it easier to manage passenger needs, ensure a smoother and more comfortable journey, and potentially enhance overall passenger satisfaction. This innovative solution offers a win-win situation, 
improving the travel experience for both passengers and airline staff.

## Tech Overview 🤖
#### Front End
We used CSS and HTML to format the UI interfaces for the Login/Register page, text box, and home page

#### Back End
We used Python to create databases to store and retrieve login information

#### API
We used live chat to create a chat box with a chat bot and libre chat to translate the chat if need so attendants may understand people who speak a different language
