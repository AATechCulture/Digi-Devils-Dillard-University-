## Project Description ðŸ¤“
This app is a dedicated communication platform designed to enhance the interaction between passengers 
and flight attendants during flights. It enables passengers to swiftly notify flight attendants about 
emergencies or specific requirements through instant notifications, ensuring quick response and 
efficient assistance. By bridging the communication gap, the app aims to create a safer and more 
comfortable travel experience for all passengers on board.


## Project Value 
An app that enables passengers to communicate with flight attendants via text would primarily target air travelers seeking a more convenient and efficient way to address their concerns during flights. This feature would benefit passengers by providing a direct and discreet means of communication, allowing them to report issues, request assistance, or ask questions without having to rely on in-person interactions or the overhead call button. For flight attendants, the app would streamline communication, making it easier to manage passenger needs, ensure a smoother and more comfortable journey, and potentially enhance overall passenger satisfaction. This innovative solution offers a win-win situation, 
improving the travel experience for both passengers and airline staff.
